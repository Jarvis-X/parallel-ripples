# parallel-ripples
A project for the practice and principle in parallel computing. We aim at generating ripples in a 2D liquid plane and rendering them in real-time under 2K+ resolution. 
The basic pattern is a sparse matrix multiplication with the frame buffer, in a fancy way.
## Technical details:
### Requirements
* Visual Studio 2019 or Setting up the environment manually
* OpenCL library/header and runtime
* A Device (preferrably GPU) that supports OpenCL 1.2 or up
### More under construction
